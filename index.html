        <p class="lead mb-4">A current undergraduate Ethiopian Student seeking to make the world a better place by pursuing an environmental science major. I plan on implementing the skills I gain in UCR to use them back home in Ethiopia. Growing up in Ethiopia I was able to experience a different background from what it's like living in the United States of America. I have had environmental experience through a series of IB-level classes in high school and also real-world problems I have tackled in my teen years. The International Baccalaureate Organization is a series of high-level education that requires interaction with the world. Through environmental science and other afterschool activities such as planting trees and more, I would say I have had a good amount of experience. In addition to this language Is no barrier for me as even though I was raised in Ethiopia, I had attended an international school that made English my first language. I am currently 20 years old and plan on pursuing further education after college as well. I have also been involved in many other smaller groups such as “Girl Up” and many more that have helped increase my communication skills. Communication is a key aspect in almost every aspect of the world we live in today. Growing up a part of a diverse community, I can confidently say that I have a high level of communication. In addition to this, I have lived in multiple parts of the world. I have lived in over three continents now. I was once in Africa, and Europe and now I am in northern America. I have also had minimal experience in the computer science field which I believe can be applicable to my environmental science future. I plan on achieving many milestones while I am attending the University of California Riverside. One of the milestones I plan on achieving is taking as many diverse electives to have a competitive advantage over other employees. For example, by taking a computer science course, I am more experienced in this field than other employees. This is a competitive advantage I have over other people in the environmental field. My current professional experiences come from high school. As I mentioned earlier, I have taken courses and also been a part of groups that I can say are outstanding. For example, as a part of a course we had planted many trees around the community. In my country, in Ethiopia, one of the most recent goals implemented by the government was to plant thousands and thousands of trees every year. With that being said, I was able to play a role in this goal by doing this in the community I was a part of. In addition to this, I have experienced this field from an outsider's view. I have interacted with other people that are potentially in a higher position in this specific area and I have been able to discuss with them to expand my knowledge in this specific field. Lastly, I have also interacted with groups not related to environmental science that can boost my abilities in this field.  <br><br>
